Stepone

Stepone is the first step to a bootstrapping operating system; first, as a proof of concept,
stepone and its associated assembler ministep will be self hosting on unix-like operaing systems.
Steptwo will be a kernel written in stepone whose purpose is to run an implementation of stepone, which can then
run the selfhosted version of stepone, still targetting ministep but perhaps generating the assembly
with different syscalls. It will need a filesystem, a text editor, and a tcp/ip stack (can't really get around
having one of those in the modern age. Perhaps packet radio is a good contender for the first tcp/ip stack this
should have?). After this point, steptwo can continue pulling itself though more steps without any reliance on external
systems.

It is a question as to what Steptwo will target. One possiblity is x86, another is ARM, and another is RISC-V. Probably x86
development is a good idea but the possiblity of RISC-V is enticing because it would be possible to run a very transparent system.

It will not be a unix. It will be a new paradigm, and realistically it will probably be worse than the unix one, but I'm aiming for
completion first.
