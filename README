Stepone
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Stepone is the first step to a bootstrapping operating system; first, as a proof of concept, stepone and its associated
assembler ministep will be self hosting on unix-like operaing systems. Steptwo will be a kernel written in stepone
whose purpose is to run an implementation of stepone, which can then run the selfhosted version of stepone, still
targetting ministep but perhaps generating the assembly with different syscalls. It will need a filesystem, a text
editor, a tcp/ip stack (can't really get around having one of those in the modern age. Perhaps packet radio is a good
contender for the first tcp/ip stack this should have?), a stepone compiler, and a standard library. After this point,
steptwo can continue pulling itself though more steps without any reliance on external systems.

It is a question as to what Steptwo will target. One possiblity is x86, another is ARM, and another is RISC-V. Probably
x86 development is a good idea but the possiblity of RISC-V is enticing because it would be possible to run a very
transparent system.

It will not be a unix. It will be a new paradigm, and realistically it will probably be worse than the unix one, but
I'm aiming for completion first.
